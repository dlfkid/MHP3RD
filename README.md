## Story

* This is a project app for me to practise in case I found anything new.
* The very first application I made for me as an iOS developer.
* I love the psp game "Monster Hunter 3 Portable" on play station portable. In my teenage time, I spent a lot of time and effort to it. So when I started to become a developer, I was wondering what app I can create, the wikipedia of this game came to my mind.
* I will keep updating it when i have the time. After 6 years, It's architecture semm pretty old and dumb. And I became a skillful developer, thanks to this project.

## Future Plan

1. Transform the architechture from **MVC** to **MVVM**
2. Wrap the data unit.
3. Migrate from OC to swift.
4. Coming soon
